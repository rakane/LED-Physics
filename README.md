### A one dimensional physics based collision simulation
### An led block starts at the beginning and end of the strip, and starts moving inwards. They infinitely bounce off each other and the ends of the led strip.

## Progress
### So far, the led block sizes can be changed, and they bounce off each other infinitely.

## TO DO
1. Implement a velocity / physics system where the blocks have mass and     collide elastically (partially working, physics slightly off)
2. Have the blocks randomly change color on each collision (partially working, only change when they collide with the wall)
3. Animate the blocks so they compress on collision and grow back out
4. Give the blocks a dim trail, a few leds long
